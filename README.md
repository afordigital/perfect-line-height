# Perfect Line Height

It is commonly understood that line-height is a 1.5 multiplier of font-size. However, this is not only a reductionist approach, but there are other factors that depend on it such as the font-family or the number of lines. This page is intended as a tool for developers to know the line-height that best suits their text.
